<h2>Twisted Announces Membership in the Software Freedom Conservancy (2008-03-16)</h2>
<p>At PyCon 2008 we were delighted to share some good news with the Python community: the announcement of the <a class="reference external" href="https://twisted.org/pages/TwistedSoftwareFoundation.html">Twisted Software Foundation</a>. Glyph had previously emailed the Twisted mail list, letting those close to the project know of this major event shortly after the paperwork was signed. Before we brought this before a more public audience, we wanted to give companies a chance to become &quot;founding sponsors&quot; -- and this is what has happened at PyCon. We're looking forward to issuing a formal press release about this (including info on the founding sponsors) and will have more details in the near future.</p>
<p>We would like to send a special thank-you out to those sponsors who made contributions immediately. In order of contribution, they are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Chris Armstrong</li>
<li>Michel Pelletier</li>
<li>AdytumSolutions, Inc.</li>
<li>tummy.com</li>
<li>Drew Perttula</li>
<li>Glenn Tarbox</li>
<li>Ilya Novoselov</li>
</ul>
<p>Read the initial announcement <a class="reference external" href="http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2008-February/016740.html">here</a>. If the video for the announcement made at PyCon gets published somewhere, we will post an update.</p>
