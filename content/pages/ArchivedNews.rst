Twisted Announces Membership in the Software Freedom Conservancy (2008-03-16)
=============================================================================

At PyCon 2008 we were delighted to share some good news with the Python community: the announcement of the `Twisted Software Foundation </content/pages/Twisted/TwistedSoftwareFoundation.html>`_. Glyph had previously emailed the Twisted mail list, letting those close to the project know of this major event shortly after the paperwork was signed. Before we brought this before a more public audience, we wanted to give companies a chance to become "founding sponsors" -- and this is what has happened at PyCon. We're looking forward to issuing a formal press release about this (including info on the founding sponsors) and will have more details in the near future.

We would like to send a special thank-you out to those sponsors who made contributions immediately. In order of contribution, they are:

* Chris Armstrong
* Michel Pelletier
* AdytumSolutions, Inc.
* tummy.com
* Drew Perttula
* Glenn Tarbox
* Ilya Novoselov

Read the initial announcement `here <http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2008-February/016740.html>`_. If the video for the announcement made at PyCon gets published somewhere, we will post an update.
